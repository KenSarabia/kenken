<h1>History of Katana</h1> <br> <br>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The katana is a type of Japanese sword that was used by samurai.
     It originated from a kind of short sword or knife called sasuga, which 
     was used by lower-ranking samurai in the Kamakura period (1185 1333)1.
     The katana evolved from another sword called tachi, and appeared in the 
     15th century2. The katana was used until the end of the 19th century, usually
      in combination with the short wakizashi2</p> <br>

      <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Description

        Mei (signature) and Nakago (tang) of an Edo period katana
        The katana is generally defined as the standard sized, moderately curved
         (as opposed to the older tachi featuring more curvature) Japanese sword with a
          blade length greater than 60.6 cm (23.86 inches) (over 2 shaku).13 It is characterized by
           its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade with a circular or squared
            guard (tsuba) and long grip to accommodate two hands. <br>
        
        With a few exceptions, katana and tachi can be distinguished from each other,
         if signed, by the location of the signature (mei) on the tang (nakago). In general, 
         the mei should be carved into the side of the nakago which would face outward when the 
         sword was worn. Since a tachi was worn with the cutting edge down, and the katana was 
         worn with the cutting edge up, the mei would be in opposite locations on the tang.</p>
